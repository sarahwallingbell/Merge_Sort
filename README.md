# Merge_Sort

Implimentation of the Merge Sort algorithm in C. 

Mergesort.c creates an unsorted array of random numbers (ranging between 0 and size-1 of array) and perfoms mergesort to sort the array. If the array is of size <= 100, it prints the array before and after sorting. Regardless of array size, it prints the time taken to sort the array in ms.
